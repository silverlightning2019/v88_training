        <h1>Helping others with your computer</h1>
        <p>A computer is a vital tool for anyone living in this day and age. This is why we aim to donate 
            every 1 in 10 computers we collect to charitable and worthy causes.</p>

        <h2>Welcome to We Collect Your IT</h2>
        <p>We offer a free collection service across the UK for the removal of your old IT systems. We safely reuse this 
            equipment by ensuring any sensitive or personal information that was on these machines is either physically
            removed or destroyed before we reuse them. Using us shall not only benefit the environment by avoiding the
            waste and disposal of this equipment but shall also help others, as we donate and proportion of all the
            equipment we collect.</p>

        <h2>Why waste? We will collect...</h2>
        <p>The environmental and social benefits of reuse do not only help conserve natural resources, but help reduce air and water pollution caused by hazardous disposal. Reuse reduces the amount of greenhouse gas emissions caused by the manufacturing of new products. It simply makes good sense to let us collect and reuse your equipment.</p>
